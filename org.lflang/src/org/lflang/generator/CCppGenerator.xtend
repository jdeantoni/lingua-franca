/** 
 * Generator for CCpp target. This class generates C++ code definining each reactor
 * class given in the input .lf file and imported .lf files. The generated code
 * has the following components:
 * 
 * * An alias for template structs for inputs, outputs, and typedefs for actions of each reactor class. These
 *   define the types of the variables that reactions use to access inputs and
 *   action values and to set output values.
 * 
 * * A typedef for a "self" struct for each reactor class. One instance of this
 *   struct will be created for each reactor instance. See below for details.
 * 
 * * A function definition for each reaction in each reactor class. These
 *   functions take an instance of the self struct as an argument.
 * 
 * * A constructor function for each reactor class. This is used to create
 *   a new instance of the reactor.
 * 
 * After these, the main generated function is `__initialize_trigger_objects()`.
 * This function creates the instances of reactors (using their constructors)
 * and makes connections between them.
 * 
 * A few other smaller functions are also generated.
 * 
 * ## Self Struct
 * 
 * The "self" struct has fields for each of the following:
 * 
 * * parameter: the field name and type match the parameter.
 * * state: the field name and type match the state.
 * * action: the field name prepends the action name with "__".
 *   A second field for the action is also created to house the trigger_t object.
 *   That second field prepends the action name with "___".
 * * output: the field name prepends the output name with "__".
 * * input:  the field name prepends the output name with "__".
 *   A second field for the input is also created to house the trigger_t object.
 *   That second field prepends the input name with "___".
 *
 * If, in addition, the reactor contains other reactors and reacts to their outputs,
 * then there will be a struct within the self struct for each such contained reactor.
 * The name of that self struct will be the name of the contained reactor prepended with "__".
 * That inside struct will contain pointers the outputs of the contained reactors
 * that are read together with pointers to booleans indicating whether those outputs are present.
 * 
 * If, in addition, the reactor has a reaction to shutdown, then there will be a pointer to
 * trigger_t object (see reactor.h) for the shutdown event and an action struct named
 * __shutdown on the self struct.
 * 
 * ## Reaction Functions
 * 
 * For each reaction in a reactor class, this generator will produce a C function
 * that expects a pointer to an instance of the "self" struct as an argument.
 * This function will contain verbatim the C code specified in the reaction, but
 * before that C code, the generator inserts a few lines of code that extract from the
 * self struct the variables that that code has declared it will use. For example, if
 * the reaction declares that it is triggered by or uses an input named "x" of type
 * int, the function will contain a line like this:
 * ```
 *     e_x_t* x = self->__x;
 * ```
 * where `r` is the full name of the reactor class and the struct type `r_x_t`
 * will be defined like this:
 * ```
 *     typedef struct {
 *         int value;
 *         bool is_present;
 *         int num_destinations;
 *     } r_x_t;
 * ```
 * The above assumes the type of `x` is `int`.
 * If the programmer fails to declare that it uses x, then the absence of the
 * above code will trigger a compile error when the verbatim code attempts to read `x`.
 *
 * ## Constructor
 * 
 * For each reactor class, this generator will create a constructor function named
 * `new_r`, where `r` is the reactor class name. This function will malloc and return
 * a pointer to an instance of the "self" struct.  This struct initially represents
 * an unconnected reactor. To establish connections between reactors, additional
 * information needs to be inserted (see below). The self struct is made visible
 * to the body of a reaction as a variable named "self".  The self struct contains the
 * following:
 * 
 * * Parameters: For each parameter `p` of the reactor, there will be a field `p`
 *   with the type and value of the parameter. So C code in the body of a reaction
 *   can access parameter values as `self->p`.
 * 
 * * State variables: For each state variable `s` of the reactor, there will be a field `s`
 *   with the type and value of the state variable. So C code in the body of a reaction
 *   can access state variables as as `self->s`.
 * 
 * The self struct also contains various fields that the user is not intended to
 * use. The names of these fields begin with at least two underscores. They are:
 * 
 * * Outputs: For each output named `out`, there will be a field `__out` that is
 *   a struct containing a value field whose type matches that of the output.
 *   The output value is stored here. That struct also has a field `is_present`
 *   that is a boolean indicating whether the output has been set.
 *   This field is reset to false at the start of every time
 *   step. There is also a field `num_destinations` whose value matches the
 *   number of downstream reactions that use this variable. This field must be
 *   set when connections are made or changed. It is used to initialize
 *   reference counts for dynamically allocated message payloads.
 * 
 * * Inputs: For each input named `in` of type T, there is a field named `__in`
 *   that is a pointer struct with a value field of type T. The struct pointed
 *   to also has an `is_present` field of type bool that indicates whether the
 *   input is present.
 * 
 * * Outputs of contained reactors: If a reactor reacts to outputs of a
 *   contained reactor `r`, then the self struct will contain a nested struct
 *   named `__r` that has fields pointing to those outputs. For example,
 *   if `r` has an output `out` of type T, then there will be field in `__r`
 *   named `out` that points to a struct containing a value field
 *   of type T and a field named `is_present` of type bool.
 * 
 * * Inputs of contained reactors: If a reactor sends to inputs of a
 *   contained reactor `r`, then the self struct will contain a nested struct
 *   named `__r` that has fields for storing the values provided to those
 *   inputs. For example, if R has an input `in` of type T, then there will
 *   be field in __R named `in` that is a struct with a value field
 *   of type T and a field named `is_present` of type bool.
 * 
 * * Actions: If the reactor has an action a (logical or physical), then there
 *   will be a field in the self struct named `__a` and another named `___a`.
 *   The type of the first is specific to the action and contains a `value`
 *   field with the type and value of the action (if it has a value). That
 *   struct also has a `has_value` field, an `is_present` field, and a
 *   `token` field (which is NULL if the action carries no value).
 *   The `___a` field is of type trigger_t.
 *   That struct contains various things, including an array of reactions
 *   sensitive to this trigger and a lf_token_t struct containing the value of
 *   the action, if it has a value.  See reactor.h in the C library for
 *   details.
 * 
 * * Reactions: Each reaction will have several fields in the self struct.
 *   Each of these has a name that begins with `___reaction_i`, where i is
 *   the number of the reaction, starting with 0. The fields are:
 *   * ___reaction_i: The struct that is put onto the reaction queue to
 *     execute the reaction (see reactor.h in the C library).
 *   * ___reaction_i_outputs_are_present: An array of pointers to the
 *     __out_is_present fields of each output `out` that may be set by
 *     this reaction. This array also includes pointers to the _is_present
 *     fields of inputs of contained reactors to which this reaction writes.
 *     This array is set up by the constructor.
 *   * ___reaction_i_num_outputs: The size of the previous array.
 *   * ___reaction_i_triggers: This is an array of arrays of pointers
 *     to trigger_t structs. The first level array has one entry for
 *     each effect of the reaction that is a port (actions are ignored).
 *     Each such entry is an array containing pointers to trigger structs for
 *     downstream inputs.
 *   * ___reaction_i_triggered_sizes: An array indicating the size of
 *     each array in ___reaction_i_triggers. The size of this array is
 *     the number of ports that are effects of this reaction.
 * 
 *  * Timers: For each timer t, there is are two fields in the self struct:
 *    * ___t_trigger: The trigger_t struct for this timer (see reactor.h).
 *    * ___t_trigger_reactions: An array of reactions (pointers to the
 *      reaction_t structs on this self struct) sensitive to this timer.
 *
 * * Triggers: For each Timer, Action, Input, and Output of a contained
 *   reactor that triggers reactions, there will be a trigger_t struct
 *   on the self struct with name `___t`, where t is the name of the trigger.
 * 
 * ## Connections Between Reactors
 * 
 * Establishing connections between reactors involves two steps.
 * First, each destination (e.g. an input port) must have pointers to
 * the source (the output port). As explained above, for an input named
 * `in`, the field `__in->value` is a pointer to the output data being read.
 * In addition, `__in->is_present` is a pointer to the corresponding
 * `out->is_present` field of the output reactor's self struct.
 *  
 * In addition, the `reaction_i` struct on the self struct has a `triggers`
 * field that records all the trigger_t structs for ports and reactions
 * that are triggered by the i-th reaction. The triggers field is
 * an array of arrays of pointers to trigger_t structs.
 * The length of the outer array is the number of output ports the
 * reaction effects plus the number of input ports of contained
 * reactors that it effects. Each inner array has a length equal to the
 * number final destinations of that output port or input port.
 * The reaction_i struct has an array triggered_sizes that indicates
 * the sizes of these inner arrays. The num_outputs field of the
 * reaction_i struct gives the length of the triggered_sizes and
 * (outer) triggers arrays.
 * 
 * ## Runtime Tables
 * 
 * This generator creates an populates the following tables used at run time.
 * These tables may have to be resized and adjusted when mutations occur.
 * 
 * * __is_present_fields: An array of pointers to booleans indicating whether an
 *   event is present. The __start_time_step() function in reactor_common.c uses
 *   this to mark every event absent at the start of a time step. The size of this
 *   table is contained in the variable __is_present_fields_size.
 * 
 * * __tokens_with_ref_count: An array of pointers to structs that point to lf_token_t
 *   objects, which carry non-primitive data types between reactors. This is used
 *   by the __start_time_step() function to decrement reference counts, if necessary,
 *   at the conclusion of a time step. Then the reference count reaches zero, the
 *   memory allocated for the lf_token_t object will be freed.  The size of this
 *   array is stored in the __tokens_with_ref_count_size variable.
 * 
 * * __shutdown_triggers: An array of pointers to trigger_t structs for shutdown
 *   reactions. The length of this table is in the __shutdown_triggers_size
 *   variable.
 * 
 * * __timer_triggers: An array of pointers to trigger_t structs for timers that
 *   need to be started when the program runs. The length of this table is in the
 *   __timer_triggers_size variable.
 * 
 * * __action_table: For a federated execution, each federate will have this table
 *   that maps port IDs to the corresponding trigger_t struct.
